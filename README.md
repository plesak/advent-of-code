Learning Rust via Advent of Code exercises. The early ones are really not great.


To run a specific day/part, use

`cargo run yYYqDqP [-f]`

where YY is 23 or 24, D is 1-25, P is 1 or 2,

and -f is added to run the "full" file

(otherwise runs on _test file for same day which has correct answer on last line)

eg to get the answer to the second part of Dec 1 2024 puzzle, use

`cargo run y24q1q2 -f`
